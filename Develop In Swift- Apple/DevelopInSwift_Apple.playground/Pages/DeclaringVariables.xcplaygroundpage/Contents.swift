/*
 Declaring a variable is almost exactly like declaring a constant. But instead of using the keyword let, you use the keyword var:
 */

// Delcaring a constant
let placeOfBirth = "New Jersey"

// Declaring a variable
var currentLocation = "New Jersey"

//Once you'he declared a variable, you can assign a new value to it:
//Assigning a new value to a variable
currentLocation = "California"

/*
 Experiment:- Below, add a line of code that assign a new value to currentLocation:
 */

currentLocation = "Newark"

/*
 In most ways, constants and variables are the same:
 
 Both use the same rules for name
 Both associate a name with an assign value
 Both have a specific type
 
 The difference is:
 The value of a constant cannot be changes after it's first assigned
 The value of a variable can be changes after it's first assigned.
