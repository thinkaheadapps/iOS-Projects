/*
 Passing a value back when a function is finished is called returning a value. To declare a function that returns a value , you have to add two things to your code
 
 After your list of parameters , add a text arrow -> and the type of value to be returned.
 For example : -> String means the function returns a String.
 
 Then you have to end the body of the function with a return statement that gives that type of value back.
