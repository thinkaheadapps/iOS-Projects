  - Experiment: Make an infinite loop in the code above by editing the `verseOne` function, so it calls `verseOne()` after it calls `merrilyDream()`. Look at the console and the results sidebar. Remove the line to stop the loop. It might take a while until the playground recovers â€“ infinite loops are hard work.
