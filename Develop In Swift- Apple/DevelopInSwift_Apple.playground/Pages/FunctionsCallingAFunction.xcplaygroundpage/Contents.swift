/*
 Print function:- Just as you perform many activities when you get dressed, many things happens when you call the print() function, including:
 . Turning whatever you give it, incuding numbers, into a string.
 . Adding a newline character , so each call to print() ends up on a new line.
 . Making that string show up in the console.
 
 . In this case , you're calling a function that someone else has already created. You don't need to know every detail about how print() works in order to call it.
 
 . Reusability is a large part of what makes function so powerful. They provide a way to combine detailed step into a definition that can be used again and again.
