 Here are a few of the other types from the Swift standard library.
 
 . Array
 . Dictionary
 . Set
 . Sequence
 . Error
 . Bool
 
 Notice that all the type names begin with a capital letter and — if there are multiple words — the first letter of each word is also capitalized. This is slightly different from the rules for naming constants, variables, and functions, which all begin with  lower-case letters.
